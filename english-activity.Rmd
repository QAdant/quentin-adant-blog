# From now on, you will use this article to include every single activity that you do in English in a chronological order (e.g. reading a book in English, watching TV shows and series in English, going to an English Evening in Mons, travelling to an English-speaking country, playing games in English such as the pretty exciting game LyricsTraining, etc.). You can even write a few lines about what you’ve watched/read/done and recommend certain things to your friends. The sky’s the limit! We value personal initiative and we will be happy to read whatever you have to offer.

13 October 2019 : I watched "Joker" the film, I really recommend it.
20 October 2019 : I watched the Star Wars's parody, "Spaceballs". I recommend it to those who have seen the first trilogy (the oldest one).
