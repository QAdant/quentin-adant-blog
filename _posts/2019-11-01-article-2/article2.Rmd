| General topic?               | Endosymbiosis between flatworms and diatoms |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The researchers fished flatworms in natural environment and imaged them. They extracted genomic DNA from them and the diatoms to sequencing it. Same thing for RNA using a RNA-sequences library preparation. They made molecular phylogenetic analyses and they made a test : they let 60 freshly collected *B.solaris* divided in 3 treatment groups starved. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They discovered that, unlike the other acoel animal, these flatworms are plastids stolen from their prey cells rather than the whole prey cells. in short-term starvation, all individuals have the same survival rates even with photosynthesis inhibitors. It is only the second case of kleptoplasty in the entire animal's tree and it is the first case involving the diatoms. |
| Remaining questions?         | They are still unable to tell which diatoms are at the origin of the sequestered plastids. lots of mechanics are still unclear. A longer starvation experiment should answer some other questions about the survival rates after more than two weeks. |
