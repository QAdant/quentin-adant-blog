| General topic?               | the seamounts : Is the mining of these oases of life wrong or not ?    |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The researchers used submarine to take bits of mineral and photos/videos of sea life on a seamount, study how the crust forms. They used the images to find eventual rare species living down there, and try to know how the mining would affect the ecosystem. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | the crust forms depending on the ocean current and the tide. the crust is thicker on the edge of the summit than on its center. It seems like more the conditions are favorable to the growth of the crust, more it is for the creatures to live there. There are a lot of species that warrentee protection and all the indicator spacies are pretty well so far. The sediments that the mining could blow up should'nt damage the ecosystem so much : it would'nt choke the sealife and the toxicity of the mineral would be neutralized by its structure. |
| Remaining questions?         | But even with tose results, we still can't know how the mining would damage the ocean ecosystems. Some mining permittings has been already given to some countries and the exploitation might begin in the 2030s. The conflict between the conservation of these seamounts and their exploitation is not over yet. |
