| Published in?                | 2nd December 2019 |
| General topic?               | the reef-dwelling parrotfish populations boom while the reef corals are dying. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | They studied the bleached area where there were corals. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They discovered that when coral population decline on a reef, microalgae and cyanobacterias investigate the place and produce a scunge that's eaten by the parrotfish. This allows the parrotfish to grow their population. The researchers suggest that parrotfish help the coral to recolonise the reef and the cycle goes on. So the parrotfish is a vital link for a well-balanced reef ecosystem. |
