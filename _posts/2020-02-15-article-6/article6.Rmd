| General topic?               | The invisible impact of the fires that put Australia in ashes. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | how the marine ecosystem responds to the arrival of the first rainfall. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The rain brings silt and ash to freshwater and sea. That put the waters under shadow so plants consume oxygen that other life being needs. Moreover, some areas are very important for some species (birth places, etc.) |
