| General topic?               | climate changes impacts on Antarctic environment and the biological responses |
| Procedure/what was examined? | the biodiversity (terrestrial and marine), sensitivity to th climate changes, the Human impacts as the arrival of non-native species by "Human-assistance" |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | the Antarctic environment faces two challenges : the impacts of the Global Warming on the long term and the direct impacts of Human activity in a shorter term. Preservation planning and management have been already set. Scientists already began to raise an *ex-situ* conservation and a first genetic repository of the Antartic species  |
| Remaining questions?         | We still don't know well how the futur will go but we have all the cards to avoid the worst. |
