| General topic?               | effects of hyperoxic environment on marine fauna and relation with the ocean warming |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The researchers used probes to get a dataset of natural warming fluctuations during a year. With these dataset, they reproduced the same conditions to test some species living in coastal habitats of the Red Sea, the warmest of the world. They also examined the differne of resistance and recover capacity of *T.crenata* crabs in acute hypoxic episodes after a normoxic and a hyperoxic day. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | During the daytime, the temperature increases in phase with the oxygen concentration increases with a short lag. This correlation doesn't exist only in tropical waters but also in temperate and polar latitudes. During the heat peak, the survivability of the ectothermals increases in oxygen supersaturationed environment. Moreover, those who have supported a hyperoxic period are more resistant to a hypoxic episode and recovered quicker. Conclusion : The effective restoration and conservation of such coastal habitats is very important to limit the damage of the global warming. |
| Remaining questions?         | none |
